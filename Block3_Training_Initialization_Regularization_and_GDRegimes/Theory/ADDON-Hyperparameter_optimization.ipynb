    "    - It can get obsolete in surprisingly short time, eg. [Bengio 2012](https://arxiv.org/abs/1206.5533) suggests values for various hyperparameters based on experience (which is interesting), but still uses prominently \"layerwise pretraining\"-et, which is totally forgotten by now. (It was quite tedious, it did not bring as much as people hoped for, but noone formally proved it wrong..)\n",
    "- Scientifically well founded method\n",
    "    - We simply don't have analytic understanding\n",
    "    - If we don't have that, how do we know anything if not by simulation? See next point...\n",
